# Confluence

This is an exploratory project into the domains of distributed computing and evolutionary AI. 
Confluence uses a Node sever on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) to communicate tasks between devices by turning the RPi into a WiFi access point.
Devices can connect as workers to the RPi and access a React based dashboard to see their status, UUID and active tasks. 
On the RPi, an administrator page is shown with the connected nodes, parameters and function inputs. 
The training is started from the administrator dashboard from where the evolution process can be viewed.

####Here are some of the things we learned along the way:
